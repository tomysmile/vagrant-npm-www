# vagrant-npm-www [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/vagrant-npm-www.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/twolfson/vagrant-npm-www)

[Vagrant][] setup for [`npm-www`][]

This was created to isolate dependency management (e.g. [elasticsearch][], [Java][]) from the host OS. When working with a new technology, we prefer to isolate ourselves from potentially shooting ourselves in the foot.

[Vagrant]: http://www.vagrantup.com/
[`npm-www`]: https://github.com/npm/npm-www

## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install vagrant-npm-www`

```javascript
var vagrant_npm_www = require('vagrant-npm-www');
vagrant_npm_www.awesome(); // "awesome"
```
